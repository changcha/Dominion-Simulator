Dominion Simulator
Pit two strategies against each other Dominion and see which one comes out on top in the long run in this re-creation of the classic card game. 

TODO:
Starting with the original card set
	- Any action card alphabetically after Festival with Test
	- Tests for player
	- Setup game structure
	- Complete GamePlan interface and then implement with the MockGamePlan
	- Implement tracking/reporting to record winning strategies/cards
	- Probably way more stuff but this is just really high level right now
